* I got the rubber suspension part modeled in FreeCAD
* Also made a PCB model based off of that
* Then I saved the PCB model as a .step, which I converted to a .dxf using the KiCAD stepup plugin
* In KiCAD, I created a new project, and imported the .dxf PCB outline into the .pcb file, so now I'm ready to rock and roll on the electronics design
